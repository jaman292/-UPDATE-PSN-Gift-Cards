These cards are typically available in both physical and digital formats and can be purchased from stores or online marketplaces.
How to Stay Safe
To ensure you’re using legitimate sources for PSN gift cards, always:

Stick to well-known, trusted platforms like Swagbucks, InboxDollars, or PlayStation’s official channels.
Avoid websites or services that ask for your credit card information upfront or promise instant rewards.
Look for user reviews or feedback before committing to any reward service.
Read the terms and conditions of any rewards platform to make sure you understand how to earn and redeem credits.
